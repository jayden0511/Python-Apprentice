# 1) Complete make_a_shape() to make the turtle move in some pattern. 
# For instance, you can make it go left 30 degrees, then forward 50 pixels, 
# then right 60 degrees, then forward 100 pixels. Make any shape you like.

# The second ... in the for loop should be the number of shapes you want to make, 
# for example 100, or it could use islice(), cycle(), or a list of numbers.
